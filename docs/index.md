## 🎯 Learning Path

### For Complete Beginners:
1. Start with Part 1 (Introduction & Setup)
2. Follow Part 2 (Function-Based Views) - Build the complete project
3. Move to Part 3 (Class-Based Views) - Refactor the same project
4. Review Part 4 (Comparison & Best Practices)

### For Those with Basic Django Knowledge:
1. Quick review of Part 1
2. Focus on Part 2 and Part 3 - Compare both approaches
3. Deep dive into Part 4 for advanced patterns

## 🚀 Project: Task Management System

Throughout this training, we build a **complete Task Management System** with:

**Features:**
- ✅ User authentication (register, login, logout)
- ✅ CRUD operations for tasks
- ✅ Task filtering and search
- ✅ Priority and status management
- ✅ Task completion tracking
- ✅ User-specific task isolation
- ✅ Responsive UI with Bootstrap
- ✅ Flash messages for user feedback

**First Implementation:** Function-Based Views (Part 2)
**Second Implementation:** Class-Based Views (Part 3)

This allows you to see the **same project implemented in both ways** and understand the differences!
